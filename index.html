      <p>Minnesota, USA.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Creative writing is one of my outlets, as well as playing my instruments. (If there's a piano, you can be sure I'm dying to play it.) Birding is another delight.</p>

      <p>Something freeing that incorporates my widespread interests.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>A green-colored house in suburbia.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Ever since I was a kid, customizing my computer and tumblrs, I've had an interest in the field. I also think these skills are some of the most applicable and useful across the board.</p>
